# WikiCompare: Comparing knowledge in wikipedia projects

The goal of this project is to compare the content/knowledge of different Wikipedia projects.
In particular, we are interested in multilingual Wikipedias and Wikidata. 

For example, looking at the University of Amsterdam:
* [UvA (Dutch)](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universiteit_van_Amsterdam)
* [UvA (English)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Amsterdam)
* [UvA (Wikidata)]((https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214341)

You see different content. The goal of this project to create quantative measures of the different. 

This is useful in the context of projects which focus on adding knowledge to knowledge bases like Wikidata.

See for example:
